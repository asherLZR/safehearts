## UML Diagrams
- [Class Diagram](./uml/ClassDiagram.pdf)
    - Does not show all class-to-class dependencies to avoid an illegible diagram. Instead, packages are shown to depend on each other.
- Sequence Diagrams

## Functional Description
Our implementation of the Safe‚ù£Heart application presents a chosen practitioner with a list of all their associated patients, pulled from the [FHIR](http://www.hl7.org/FHIR/) server, allowing them to optionally add monitors to various observation types (e.g. Cholesterol).

![patients](./markdown-assets/rsz_patients.jpg "Patients Page")

These patient observations are presented to the practitioner on a dashboard, which refreshes its data (i.e. pull new observations from the server) every hour.

## Design principles and patterns
Smile uses its own internal data models like `ShPatientReference` and `ShPatient`. These objects are created by the `HealthService` class, defined as abstract to enforce a standard interface for all services. 

The **adapter pattern**, adds a layer of abstraction so interoperability may be achieved. By adapting the service-specific model to the specified internal interface, we achieve **dependency inversion** - clients rely not on a `FhirService` but a `HealthService`, which in turn informs the implementation of `FhirService`. The benefit of this approach is that the rest of the app does not rely on a concrete service, which leads to improved extensibility when services are added in the future.

The **observer pattern** ensures that the UI is updated when the underlying data changes. We have used the observer pattern as the UI needs to react to multiple events, such as loading the asynchronously from the network and refreshing the data every hour).

![poll](./markdown-assets/rsz_polling.png "Poll")

The **model-view-controller (MVC) architectural pattern** is used throughout the app to aid in separation of concerns. The benefit of our approach is that the business logic of the app (such as persistence) can be changed independently of the UI, which reduces bugs caused by tightly coupled code (i.e. code that combines both the Android API and business logic in a single class). A related benefit is that the view layer can be easily changed, promoting extensibility of our solution.
